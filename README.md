# Monkey

This is an implementation of the Monkey language, designed (to my knowledge) by Thorsten Bell for his book *Writing an Interpreter in Go*. Most of it follows his tutorial, with some (probably bug-inducing) code refactoring.

Some of my additions (haven't finished the book, maybe they're covered later):

- Unicode support
- String escapes
- Better error handling (row/col position)

## Todo

### Parsing
- Function calls
- If/else
- Arrays

### Interpretation
- Everything

### Other
- General refactoring
- Ternary if-else
- Postfix operators (++, --, maybe ! for factorial just cause)
