# Monkey

This is an implementation of the Monkey language, designed (to my knowledge) by Thorsten Bell for his book *Writing an Interpreter in Go*. Most of it follows his tutorial, with some (probably bug-inducing) additions and code simplification.

## Todo

### Parsing
- Function definitions
- Function calls
- If/else
- Arrays

### Interpretation
- Everything

### Other
- General refactoring
- Ternary if-else
- Postfix operators (++, --, maybe ! for factorial just cause)
